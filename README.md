# Connect4AI

This project was created for Hack Emory's Semester Long Project. 

This project is the game Connect 4 which plays against an AI using minimax. The AI works but needs to be improved still.

This code is the completed version of the code.

Students will implement their own version of the game and can use this code as a guidline.
